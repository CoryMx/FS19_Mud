    #example <Layers>
         #example <CombinedLayer name="ROUGHDIRT" layers="roughDirt01;roughDirt02;roughDirt03;roughDirt04" noiseFrequency="2"/>
	      	  <CombinedLayer name="ROUGHDIRT2" layers="roughDirt01;roughDirt02;roughDirt03;roughDirt04" noiseFrequency="2"/>      *ONLY ADD THIS LINE to existing list below rough dirt1  - not this note*
    #example </LayerCombiner>
    
    
	Add this line* to FoliageMultiLayer 

     #example	<FoliageMultiLayer densityMapId="295" numChannels="10" numTypeIndexChannels="5" compressionChannels="5">
           #example <FoliageType name="wheat" foliageXmlId="303"/>
           #example <FoliageType name="grass" foliageXmlId="304"/>
		    <FoliageType name="dirty" foliageXmlId="99999998"/>		    *ONLY ADD THIS LINE to existing list  - not this note*

	2. you can paint "dirty" shown under foliage layer and state "paintdirty" <- Important or mistake was made above.
	3. save id3.


Open you ModDesc.xml from (Yourmap) folder and add source file line*

   #example </extraSourceFiles>


Open map.xml (Yourmap) and add the groundTypeMapping Line* into the groundTypeMappings section in your map.xml Adjust the layer to the entry you made in map.i3d, also adjust the paintableFoliageId
	
   #example <groundTypeMappings>
	          <groundTypeMapping type="dirt2"          layer="ROUGHDIRT2" paintableFoliageId="6" />       *ONLY ADD THIS LINE to existing list  - not this note*
   #example </groundTypeMappings>
    
    
  Add the paintableFoliage Line* to your paintableFoliages section in your map.xml Adjust the paintableFoliageId to the first free ID
   
    #example <paintableFoliages>
		   <paintableFoliage id="6" layerName="dirty" firstDensityMapChannel="0" numDensityMapChannels="1" value="1"  />   *ONLY ADD THIS LINE to existing list  - not this note*
    #example </paintableFoliages>
	
*Note icon in ingame paint tool will apear as dirt. the second icon is the mud. 
** Note mud will only spawn if mostiure levels are low enough, if not it will apear as dirt. 
this can be edited in scripte/DynamicMud.lua line 53 for season and 57 without seasons. 

Line 140 = DynamicMud.ALWAYS_MUD_CHANNEL = 1

not sure if this can be changed to 0 or 2 for mud all the time ?
